#OBSERVATIONS
## Scatter Plot (The plot of Number of Deep Tubewells v/s Cost in Construction)
1. In 2000-01, the plot low positive correlation with high variance
2. In 2001-02, 2002-03,2003-04,2004-05,2005-06,2006-07; the plot shows high postive correlation with low variance
3. Overall, from 2000 to 2007, the plot shows low positive correlation with high variance.
4. The construction of number of deep tubewells has decreased over the years.

## Box Plot (The box plots of Number of Deep Tubewells construction for each year between 2000 to 2007)
1. There are many outliers
2. The data is left skewed 

## Bar Plot (Plot of Number of Deep Tubewells constructed in each state for the years between 2000 to 2007)
